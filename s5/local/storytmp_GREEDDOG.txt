The Greedy Dog illustrated by Kim Kelley "What a great time I'll have eating this meat when I get home!" said Bill the dog. He began to cross a stream of water. He stopped suddenly and looked down into the water. There was another dog looking back at him from inside the stream! "Hey! He has a bigger piece of meat than I do!" he said. "I want that piece, and I'm going to get it!" Bill growled, but the dog in the water did not move. He didn't drop his meat either. Bill stared very hard at the dog in the water. Bill thought that if he could scare him, the other dog would drop his meat.  Bill barked at the dog in the water. He was soon sorry for that, because the meat slipped from his mouth and sank to the bottom of the stream. The dog in the water lost his meat at the same time, and poor Bill went home hungry.
