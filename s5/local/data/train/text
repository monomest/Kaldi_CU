02130-11900 WHAT'S THE GREAT GRAVITY MACHINE ASKED JEFF
02130-11901 THAT'S THE NAME OF THE ROLLER COASTER LISA POINTED TOWARD A BIG STEEL HILLS WOW IT'S HUGE SAID MIKE
02130-11902 I CAN SEE WAY

02130-11916 THAT'S RIGHT LISA REPLIED
02130-11917 OUR YOUR BICYCLE AND THE ROLLER COASTER BOTH USE GRAVITY
02130-11918 BUT THERE IS ONE BIG DIFFERENCE YOUR BIKE HAS PEDALS THE COASTER CARS HAVE NO PEDALS AND NO ENER
02130-11919 ENGINE
02130-11920 ENGINE
02130-11921 THE ROLLER COASTER IS MADE OF SI

02172-12612 RACE IS A GOOD HONOR
02172-12613 THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME IN THEIR VILLAGE
02172-12614 IT HAD BEEN IN SL SLUDGE POND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THEIR TURTLE
02172-12615 THERE WAS THE MOST FAMOUS TURTLE
02172-12616 THERE WAS
02172-12617 HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
02172-12618 HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS THERE WAS

02172-12627 WHEN MUD
02172-12628 WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND FOR THE TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH WHEN SWISH WAS BORN
02172-12629 EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT AS HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
02172-12630 ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM IN FOR DINNER
02172-12631 AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL
02172-12632 BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING
02172-12633 AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
02172-12634 BLUE POND WAS A NICE VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM GREAT POND
02172-12635 THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER A CE
02172-12636 SEVEN
02172-12637 HUNDRED YEARS SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST
02172-12638 MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP TO THEIR POND
02172-12639 TO THEIR LITTLE POND
02172-12640 EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE

02172-12649 WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE
02172-12650 BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE
02172-12651 SHELL WAXING
02172-12652 THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
02172-12653 ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE HE THOUGHT SURE

02172-12720 RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP
02172-12721 SINCE IF

02172-12724 SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN
02172-12725 THOUGH HE KNEW
02172-12726 THEM BY HEART
02172-12727 THEN HE HEARD

02172-12739 THERE RISE JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
02172-12740 ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW

02172-12742 MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO SWISH AND MUD
02172-12743 WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
02172-12744 IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
02172-12745 THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE S SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARDLY TO TELL AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL
02172-12746 TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
02172-12747 BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD
02172-12748 BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
02172-12749 MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
02172-12750 WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
02172-12751 MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG
02172-12752 AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW EVEN I WAS
02172-12753 FASTER THAN YOU
02172-12754 WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING
02172-12755 YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
02172-12756 BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
02172-12757 YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT
02172-12758 I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID
02172-12759 TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
02172-12760 THEN MUD TRIED
02172-12761 ANOTHER TRICK

02172-12763 SWISH STARTED YAWNING
02172-12764 HE WAS TIRED
02172-12765 HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
02172-12766 THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OF H THIS TRICK
02172-12767 HE REACHED IN HIS SHELL AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
02172-12768 HE PUT THE EARPLUGS ON HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
02172-12769 THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED
02172-12770 THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING
02172-12771 BUT THEN RIGHT AS THE END
02172-12772 BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET

05062-16341 <SPOKEN_NOISE> IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
05062-16342 FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND THE TURTLES
05062-16343 THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
05062-16344 HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TH TO THE TIGERS

05062-16352 ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT WAS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
05062-16353 THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY

05062-16356 MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT AND A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY
05062-16357 SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
05062-16358 <NOISE> BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT ONLY THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
05062-16359 THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
05062-16360 AS AT FUTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
05062-16361 FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
05062-16362 SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UNCUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDAS HOME
05062-16363 <SPOKEN_NOISE> IT'S INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THAN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED
05062-16364 THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
05062-16365 BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
05062-16366 ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME AND VISIT THE ZOO

05062-16368 IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
05062-16369 I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
05062-16370 !SIL
05062-16371 FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE HE QUICKLY SAID

05062-16391 BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
05062-16392 BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO T'WOULD BE NICE TO BE IT T'WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
05062-16393 NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY

05062-16397 !SIL
05062-16398 AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
05062-16399 BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING <SPOKEN_NOISE> <NOISE> AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
05062-16400 THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
05062-16401 MAGGIE FIGURED IF SHE AND THE THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
05062-16402 ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT

05062-16409 SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE

05062-16412 NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR TO AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
05062-16413 THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
05062-16414 A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD IF SHE WANTED
05062-16415 !SIL
05062-16416 A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
05062-16417 IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER A THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
05062-16418 NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
05062-16419 SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDA FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
05062-16420 IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
05062-16421 OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT AND THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
