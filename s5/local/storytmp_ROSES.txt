Pink Roses Illustrated By Kim Kelley Once, a long time ago, there were no pink roses. All the roses in the world were white. There weren't any red ones, any yellow ones, or any pink ones. There were only white roses. Very early one morning, a little white rosebud woke up. She saw the sun looking at her. He stared so hard that the little white rosebud didn't know what to do. So she looked up at him and said, "Why are you looking at me so hard?" "Because you are so pretty!" said the big round sun. And the little white rosebud blushed! She turned pink. After that, all her children were little pink roses.
