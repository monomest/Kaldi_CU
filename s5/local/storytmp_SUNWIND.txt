The Sun and The Wind modified by Taylor Struemph illustrated by Nigel Sussman This is the Sun. This is the Wind. One day, the Sun said to the Wind "I am better than you." "You are not so strong," said the wind. "I am better!" A man in a coat walked by. "We will see who is better now," said the Wind. "The one who can make him take off his coat is stronger." "Okay", said the Sun. The wind blew at the man. He blew hard. He made it rainy and cold. But the man pulled his coat close. The Wind could not get it off. The wind blew at the man. He blew hard. He made it rainy and cold. But the man pulled his coat close. The Wind could not get it off. The Sun tried. He shone on the man. It got warmer and warmer. The man took his coat off. The Sun won!
