The Boy and The Nuts modified by Taylor Struemph Illustrated By Kim Kelley A glass jar half full of nuts was on a table. Albert, who loved nuts, saw it. He climbed up on the table and put his hand into the jar. He grabbed a whole handful. Then, he tried to pull his hand out. The mouth of the jar was too small for his fist. He pulled and pulled and became very angry at the jar, but it was no use. His hand was stuck! At last he began to scream and cry. His mother ran to the room to see what was wrong with him. "What's the matter, Albert?" she asked. "This mean old jar will not let me have this handful of nuts!" cried Albert. His mother laughed when she saw the cause of all his trouble. "You greedy boy! You don't need a whole handful at once," she said. "Try taking out a few at a time." Albert let go of the nuts and took only two. His hand came out easily. "When you get into trouble again, stop and think of a way to fix it instead of screaming," said his mother. "And next time, don't be so greedy."
