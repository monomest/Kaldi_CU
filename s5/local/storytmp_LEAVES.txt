The Leaves and The Roots modified by Taylor Struemph "We make cool shade on the green grass," said the flapping leaves. "We dress the tree in fresh and quiet green. It is bare and brown without us.  Tired people and hot animals are happy for our shade. Children love to play under us.  At night the song birds of the woods fly to us for our safety. We hide the nests of mother birds.  The light winds stay with us and play with us." And the leaves felt very proud and important. "What you say is all very true, but you should not forget us," said a voice from the earth. "We are surely worth something." "And who are you? Where do you grow?" asked the leaves. We are deep in the ground, far below you, but we feed the stems and make you grow. We are the roots. You owe your beauty to us. We are not pretty like you are, but we do not die.  Winter does not change us. But when it comes you fall. The tree stands firm. We hold it in place. If we died, the tree would die and you would die with it."
