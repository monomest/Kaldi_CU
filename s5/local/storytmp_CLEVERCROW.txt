The Clever Crow Illustrated by Kim Kelly It had not rained in many weeks. All the streams and all the ponds were dried up. The Clever Crow Illustrated by Kim Kelly It had not rained in many weeks. All the streams and all the ponds were dried up. An old crow had been looking for water all morning. At last he found some in a pitcher in a garden. He flew down to it and stuck in his bill, but he could not reach the water.  He walked over to the other side and tried again. He still could not reach. He looked at the cool water. Oh, how thirsty he was! He felt faint.  "I must have that water! I'm going to get it," he said. He stretched his neck into the pitcher until it was sore, but could not reach the water. He stopped for a second and thought. Then he said, "My beak is strong and hard. I'll break the pitcher." So he gave the pitcher a hard thump. It did not break. He pecked at it, first here and then there. It did not even crack. What a strong pitcher it was! "This simply won't do," he said. "I have to try some other plan. I am big and strong. I will tip the pitcher over." He pushed against the pitcher with his chest. It did not move. Nearby in the garden lay some pebbles. The crow picked one up and let it fall into the pitcher.  He dropped in another, then another. He could see the water rise a little. Now he worked harder than ever. Soon the water was high enough that he could reach it. How wonderful it tasted! He drank as much as he wanted and flew away. Because he used his head, and did not give up, he won!
