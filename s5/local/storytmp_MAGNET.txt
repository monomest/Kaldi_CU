"Oops!" cried Jack. "I spilled my tacks." "What a mess!" said Donna. "Take this bar. It will help you." Jack took the bar. Jack looked at the bar. Then he moved it near the tacks. Tacks stuck to the bar. "It's magic!" Jack said "It is not magic," Donna said. "That bar is a magnet. It pulls the tacks." "It will pull anything!" shouted Jack. "Watch this!" Jack pulled the tacks from the bar. He put them in the box. He put the box on the ladder. Donna shook her head. Jack pointed the magnet at a red apple. Jack wiggled the magnet. The apple did not move. "Watch me pick up that penny!" Jack said. "I will use my magic bar." Jack moved the magnet near a penny. "Move!" Jack shouted. The penny did not move. Donna smiled. She got her paper clips.  Donna loved paper clips.  "Let's try these," she said. "Watch," said Donna. She took the bar.  She moved the bar near a shiny paper clip. The paper clip jumped onto the magnet. Donna moved a new paper clip near the first clip. The new clip jumped onto the first clip.  "A chain!" Jack shouted. "Make a chain of paper clips!" Donna made a big chain. She smiled at Jack. "It is magic," Jack said. "No. Magnets only pull some things," said Donna. "Magnets pull paper clips and tacks." "But not apples and pennies," said Jack. "Can magnets pull other magnets?" asked Jack. "I have two magnets. Let's try them," Donna said. Donna took the magnets.  Jack looked at them.  Each magnet was red and black. Donna put the red end of one magnet next to the black end of the other magnet. "Woo!" cried Jack. "Magnets pull other magnets!" "Try to put the two black ends together," said Donna. "Oh no," said Jack. "The magnets will not go together. The magnets are pushing apart." "I broke them," Jack cried. "No, you did not break them," Donna laughed. "That's how magnets work," said Donna.  "The ends that are the same color push apart." "And ends with different colors pull together!" Jack said. Jack held the magnets over his head. He started to jump. Jack jumped up and down. Jack bumped into the ladder. The box of tacks fell. Tacks spilled all over the floor. "Oops," Jack said. "What a mess!" Donna said. Jack knew what to do. He used the magnets to pick up all the tacks. "It's not magic," Jack said. "It's magnets."
