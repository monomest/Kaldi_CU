The doorbell rang. Rosa put down her new camera. She went to the door. She saw Mrs. Fine, her neighbor. "Hi, Rosa," Mrs. Fine said. "Is your Dad home?" "I'm right here," said Dad. "Can I help you?" "I want to plant a garden," said Mrs. Fine. "I want to cut down that old tree. It is half on my land and half on yours. Do you mind if I cut it down?" "Oh, no," said Rosa. "Please don't cut down that tree." "But the shade from that tree will stop my garden from growing," Mrs. Fine said. The doorbell rang. Rosa put down her new camera. She went to the door.

"But the shade from that tree will stop my garden from growing," Mrs. Fine said. Dad looked at Rosa. She looked so sad.  "I don't know, Mrs. Fine," Dad said. "I want to think about it. I'll call you later." "Why are you sad, Rosa?" asked Dad. "That tree is important," said Rosa. "It has a bird's nest with baby birds. I watch them from my window."  "Is that all?" Dad asked. "No, Dad. A squirrel lives in the tree, too. A chipmunk lives by the big root. What will happen if Mrs. Fine cuts down their home?" "Why don't you tell Mrs. Fine about the animals. Maybe she will plant her garden someplace else," Dad said. "Hello, Rosa", said Mrs. Fine. "Hello. I want to talk about the tree," said Rosa.  "Baby birds live in the tree. A squirrel lives there, and so does a chipmunk. If you cut the tree down, they won't have a home." "I've never seen the birds' nest. I don't think squirrels or chipmunks live in that tree," said Mrs. Fine. "You must prove that they live there."  "If I show you, will you plant your garden someplace else?" asked Rosa. "It's a deal," said Mrs. Fine. Rosa went home. She got her camera. She also got some bread. "The bread will make the animals come out," she said. "Then I can take pictures of them." Rosa put bits of bread around the tree. Then she moved back from the tree. The mother bird came first. She took some bread and flew back to her nest. "Click," went Rosa's camera. The little chipmunk ran around the tree. When he felt safe, he took some bread. He carried it to his hole in the tree. "Click!" Rosa took a picture of him going into his hole. Rosa waited for the squirrel. She didn't wait long. The squirrel came out of the hole in the tree. "Click!" Now Rosa had pictures of all her animal friends. Two days later, the pictures were ready. "You took nice pictures," Dad said. "Show them to Mrs. Fine right away." "I will," said Rosa. She walked across the grass to Mrs. Fine's house. Rosa showed Mrs. Fine the pictures. Mrs. Fine was surprised. "You did a good job, Rosa," said Mrs. Fine. "Now I will not cut down that tree. It's too important. The animals all have homes there." "Oh, thank you," Rosa said. Mrs. Fine smiled. "Let's go see your animal friends." "Yes!" cried Rosa. "And then we can find a place for your garden."
