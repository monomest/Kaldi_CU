 THE PANDA  WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND THE TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TH- TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BE- TO BEING EATEN  NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO  FRED WAIT EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT WAS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY THERE WERE THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER  MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE- THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT AND A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT ONLY THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S A LAW OF NATURE AS AT FUTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UNCUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDAS HOME IT'S INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THAN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME AND VISIT THE ZOO I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN- SAN ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN  FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE HE QUICKLY SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HA- I W- I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US  AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED MOON INDEED NONSENSE  YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS IT'S SIMPLE ECON- ECONOMICS  LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOME VERY AND I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO T'WOULD BE NICE TO BE IT T'WOULD BE BEST TO FLY NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY HEARD WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A BOY LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET YIN YIN HAS- WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER  AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND MAGGIE FIGURED IF SHE AND THE THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID  I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE UHM ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID HOW TO TURN YOUR HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITH GETTING A TERR- WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR TO AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD IF SHE WANTED  A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER A THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDA FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT AND THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME  FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS TH- THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO KEEP- MANAGER WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER INSTEAD OF A BUSINESS WOMAN I SEE FRED ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCH- BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY BACK AT THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER A HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK WAS- TO SAY WAS NONSENSE AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
