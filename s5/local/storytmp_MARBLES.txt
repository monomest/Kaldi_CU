Mr. Gray lived next door.  He never smiled. Bill felt sad.  He wanted to cheer up Mr. Gray. Bill thought about the contest at Mr. Higgins' store. Mr. Higgins had a jar filled with marbles. The child who guessed the number of marbles would win them all. "I will win the marbles," thought Bill. "I will give them to Mr. Gray. That will make him happy!" Bill ran to the store. "How much does that jar weigh?" he asked Mr. Higgins. Mr. Higgins put the jar on a scale. "Five pounds! That's a lot of marbles!" Bill said. He ran to the door. "Goodbye, Mr. Higgins. I am going to Aunt Jane's house. I know how to win the contest." "Hi, Aunt Jane," said Bill. " Can I use your old marbles? I want to win the contest at Mr. Higgins' store." "How will my marbles help?" asked Aunt Jane. She handed Bill a big bag of marbles. "Mr. Higgins weighed the jar of marbles," said Bill. "It weighed five pounds. I will find out how many marbles make five pounds." "I have some jars," said Aunt Jane. "Does Mr. Higgins' jar look like one of these?" Bill looked at Aunt Jane's jars. One looked bigger than Mr. Higgins's jar. One was smaller. The third was about the same size. "You can use my scale," said Aunt Jane. Bill put the big jar on the scale. He filled it with marbles. The marbles weighed six pounds. Then he filled the small jar. The marbles weighed three pounds. Then he filled the third jar with marbles. The marbles weighed five pounds. That was the same as Mr. Higgins' jar. "Now I will count the marbles," Bill said. Bill counted 360 marbles. He wrote that number. The next day, Bill went to the store. "Mr. Higgins, I have my number," Bill said. "Good," said Mr. Higgins. "Let me see it." He read the number on the paper. "Bill, you win! How did you find out the number?" "I filled three jars with marbles and weighed them," said Bill. "One jar weighed five pounds. I counted the marbles in that jar." "That was smart, Bill," said Mr. Higgins. "Thank you, Mr. Higgins," said Bill. He took the jar. "Now I can go to see Mr. Gray." Mr. Gray was on his porch. "I brought you a gift," Bill said. "I won it in a contest. I won it for you." Mr. Gray didn't smile. Bill started to leave. "Wait," said Mr. Gray. " Won't you stay and play marbles?" Bill turned to look at Mr. Gray. Mr. Gray was smiling! He looked happy. "Sure!" Bill said.
