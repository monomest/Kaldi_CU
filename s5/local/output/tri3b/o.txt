< 05062-16344 HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED THE TO THE TIGERS 
< 05062-16345 HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BE WAS TO BE ME

< 05062-16347 NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE AN 
< 05062-16348 SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WAS AN A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FOR IT TO 
< 05062-16349 
< 05062-16350 FRED WAIT EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN AS TIME TO FEED THE TIGHT IT 
< 05062-16351 FOR FED WHEN HE CAN THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HAIR 
< 05062-16352 ACTUALLY IS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE FINE WAS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS 
< 05062-16353 THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY 
< 05062-16354 THERE WERE IT THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER POO POO A THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER 
< 05062-16355 
< 05062-16356 MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT AND A LOT OF THEM DO KING GET QUITE HEAVY 
< 05062-16357 SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE 
< 05062-16358 BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT ALL MADE THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS 
< 05062-16359 THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF THE PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FATHER IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S ALL OF NATURE AS 
< 05062-16360 IS AT FOR THE DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS 
< 05062-16361 FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT TO BE DANGEROUS 
< 05062-16362 SO ALL THE THERE PEOPLE IN THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PAN IS A JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UNCUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDAS HOME 
< 05062-16363 IT'S INTERESTING TO POIN OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD IT THE ZOO GIFT SHOPS THAN ALL OF THE THERE STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED

> 05062-16349 !SIL
> 05062-16350 FRED WAIT EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS

> 05062-16352 ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT WAS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
> 05062-16353 THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
> 05062-16354 THERE WERE THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER

> 05062-16356 MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT AND A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY
> 05062-16357 SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
> 05062-16358  BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT ONLY THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
> 05062-16359 THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
> 05062-16360 AS AT FUTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
> 05062-16361 FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
> 05062-16362 SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UNCUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDAS HOME
> 05062-16363  IT'S INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THAN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED
> 05062-16364 THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS

> 05062-16366 ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME AND VISIT THE ZOO
