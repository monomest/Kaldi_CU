One day, a frog was out walking. He saw a mouse. "There is a silly mouse," he said. "I will play a joke on him. It will be fun!" "Good morning little mouse. How are you today?" said the frog. "I am fine," said the mouse. "How are you?" "I don't feel good today, so I am out walking. Will you walk with me?" said the frog. "Okay!" said the mouse. "I am not busy. It will be fun!" They walked together for a while. The frog said, "Let me tie your foot to by back leg. That way, I won't lose you." "Okay," said the mouse. "That will make us close friends." The frog took some string and tied the mouse to his leg. When the frog hopped, the mouse hopped too. It was funny. They laughed.  They went to a field. The frog ate bugs, and the mouse ate grass. After the field, they went to a lake. The mouse cried when he saw the water. "I do not like the water, frog. I want to go to the barn." The mean frog said, "I think you need a bath, mouse. You have never had one, and it is hot. Come on! It will feel good." The frog jumped into the water. The mouse tried to get away, but could not. The frog laughed.  Then a hawk flew by and saw the mouse. Hawks eat mice. The hawk flew down and took the mouse. The frog was tied to the mouse, so he went too. The hawk ate the mouse and the frog. The other frogs found out about their friend. They said "Served him right!" and no frogs ever played a mean joke again.
