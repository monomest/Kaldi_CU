I asked Mom and Dad for a brother or sister. "I want someone to play with," I told them. They brought Luis home from the hospital. He was just a baby! He couldn't do anything! "Can we trade him in?" I asked. "Of course we can't trade him in. He is your brother!" they said. Now Luis is six months old. He can't do much. He's not much fun. My cat had kittens. The kittens can run, jump, and climb. They are lots of fun. They are only three months old. They are younger than Luis. I asked Mom and Dad for a brother or sister. "I want someone to play with," I told them.

Now Luis is six months old. He can't do much. He's not much fun. My cat had kittens. The kittens can run, jump, and climb. They are lots of fun. They are only three months old. They are younger than Luis. All Luis does is sleep. Well, sometimes he cries. He eats a lot, too. "How long does it take a baby to grow?" I asked. "The kittens are younger than Luis. They can do many things. Luis has a problem. He can't do anything!" "Look at your kittens," Mom said. "They are almost as big as their mother. But people take longer to grow than kittens do. Soon Luis will be able to do things. Soon he will be more fun." Mom took some pictures from a box. They were baby pictures. My baby pictures. Mom said, "Once you were as small as Luis. See how much you have grown in six years." Then Luis started to cry. "Lunch time," said Mom. "You and Luis need lots of good food to do all that growing." That gave me an idea. Maybe Luis wasn't growing fast because he didn't eat the right food. Kittens eat kitten food. They grow very fast. Maybe if Mom fed Luis kitten food, he'd grow fast, too. Mom didn't like that idea. "Kitten food is for kittens," she told me. "You and Luis need people food to grow. You need food from each of the four food groups." "What are the four food groups, Mom?" I asked. "One group is dairy foods, like milk and cheese. A second group is meats, like chicken and fish. Eggs and nuts are in the meat group, too. A third group is breads and cereals. And the fourth group is fruits and vegetables." I thought about the problem with Luis. Maybe he did not eat enough. He could never grow just eating baby food.  "Luis should eat the same foods that I eat. Maybe he would grow faster," I said. "He can't eat the food that you eat," Mom said. "He only has two teeth. He can't chew well" I didn't think of that. Luis only had two teeth! It can't be fun being a baby, even for Luis. I eat all the things that make me grow. I like the foods I eat. Maybe the problem with Luis is that he's a baby. He can't do anything about it. Soon he'll grow. Then he'll be a real kid, just like me.  Until then, I'll play with the kittens.
